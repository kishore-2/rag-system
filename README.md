# RAG System with Gradio

## Overview
This project, **"Chat with Your Documents"**, was developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship 5.0** program. The application implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  system using Python, LangChain, and Gradio. It enables users to upload a PDF and interact with its content by asking queries. The system uses advanced AI to retrieve relevant content and provide meaningful answers. 

---

## Features
- Upload your own PDF or use the example PDF here --> **"[AI in Health Care  REPORT.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18326815/AI.in.Health.Care.REPORT.pdf)"**
).
- Automatically split documents into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
- Retrieve relevant content using a FAISS vector store.
- Generate context-aware answers with the Groq API.
